Cant get modality introduction for next:
- Next requires that there is a next in the context
  + Current setup does not support this
    * Specifically, we must prove: `modality_mixin_emp : emp ‚ä¢ M emp;`

Cannot use iMod for eventually/next:
- Tactic (and typeclasses) do not support updating the proof context
  + We would need to throw away everything else
